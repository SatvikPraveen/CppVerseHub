namespace CppVerseHub::Patterns {

// Most of the Builder pattern implementation is contained in the header file
// as inline methods and template implementations. This source file contains
// any complex implementations that are better suited for separate compilation.

// The Builder pattern is heavily template-based and uses modern C++ features
// like smart pointers and STL containers, so most functionality is implemented
// directly in the header for better performance and to avoid linking issues.

// Any future complex implementations or platform-specific code would go here.
