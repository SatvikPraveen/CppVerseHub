// CppVerseHub - State Pattern Implementation for Mission State Management

namespace CppVerseHub::Patterns {

// Most of the State pattern implementation is contained in the header file
// as inline methods and class definitions. This source file provides any
// additional implementations that are better suited for separate compilation.

// The State pattern implementation uses modern C++ features extensively,
// including smart pointers, STL containers, and chrono for time management.
// Most functionality is implemented directly in the header for performance
// and to maintain the integrity of the template-based design.

// Any future platform-specific implementations or complex algorithms
// would be added here.
