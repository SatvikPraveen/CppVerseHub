**Design Patterns Used:**

- Singleton (ResourceManager)

### 3. Domain Model Layer

Contains the business logic and domain entities:

- **Mission System**: Polymorphic mission types with strategy-based routing
- **Navigation System**: Pathfinding algorithms with adapter pattern for legacy systems
- **Fleet Builder**: Complex object construction using builder pattern
- **Communication**: Async messaging between entities
- **Data Models**: Strong typing for domain concepts
- **Validation**: Business rule enforcement and constraint checking

**OOP Principles Demonstrated:**

- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Encapsulation with proper access control
- Abstraction through interfaces
- Composition over inheritance where appropriate

### 4. C++ Feature Showcase Layer

Dedicated components demonstrating advanced C++ concepts:

- **Template Programming**: Generic containers, SFINAE, variadic templates, meta-programming
- **STL Mastery**: Comprehensive use of containers, algorithms, iterators, functors
- **Memory Management**: Smart pointers, RAII, custom allocators, memory pools
- **Concurrency**: Thread pools, async operations, synchronization primitives, lock-free programming

- **Custom Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, graph algorithms, custom data structures

### 5. Infrastructure Layer

Supporting systems and tools:

- **Build System**: CMake with modular configuration
- **Testing Framework**: Unit, integration, and benchmark tests
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated API docs and comprehensive guides
- **Development Tools**: Code formatting, static analysis, automation scripts
- **External Dependencies**: Minimal, well-chosen third-party libraries

## Architectural Principles

### SOLID Principles Implementation

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

   - Each class has a single, well-defined purpose
   - Entity classes focus solely on their domain behavior
   - Managers handle only their specific concerns

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

   - Mission types are extensible without modifying existing code
   - Strategy pattern allows new algorithms without changing navigation system
   - Plugin architecture enables feature additions

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

   - All derived mission types can substitute for base Mission class
   - Entity implementations properly extend base Entity behavior
   - Interface contracts are maintained across inheritance hierarchies

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

   - Small, focused interfaces prevent unnecessary dependencies
   - Observer pattern uses minimal notification interfaces
   - Command interfaces are action-specific

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions
   - Factory pattern decouples creation from usage
   - Strategy pattern inverts control of algorithm selection

### Additional Design Principles

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Code reuse through inheritance, templates, and utilities
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Clear, readable implementations over clever tricks
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Features implemented only when needed
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Favored where relationships are "has-a" rather than "is-a"
- **Fail Fast**: Early validation and clear error reporting
- **Exception Safety**: Strong guarantee preferred, basic guarantee minimum

## Data Flow Architecture

### Request Processing Flow

1. **User Input** → Application Layer validation
2. **Command Creation** → Core Engine processes and routes
3. **Domain Logic** → Business rules applied in Domain Layer
4. **Feature Demonstration** → C++ concepts showcased
5. **Response Generation** → Results formatted and returned
6. **Infrastructure Support** → Logging, monitoring, persistence

### Event-Driven Communication

- Observer pattern enables loose coupling between components
- Events flow through well-defined channels
- Async processing prevents blocking operations
- Error events trigger appropriate recovery mechanisms

## Concurrency Architecture

### Thread Safety Strategy

- **Immutable Objects**: Preferred where possible for natural thread safety
- **Synchronization Primitives**: Mutexes, condition variables for shared state
- **Lock-Free Structures**: For high-performance scenarios
- **Actor Model**: Message passing for entity communication
- **Thread Pools**: Managed worker threads for parallel processing

### Async Operations

- Mission execution happens asynchronously
- Resource allocation uses future/promise patterns
- Communication between entities is non-blocking
- Background tasks don't interfere with main simulation

## Memory Management Strategy

### Smart Pointer Usage

- `std::unique_ptr` for exclusive ownership
- `std::shared_ptr` for shared ownership with reference counting
- `std::weak_ptr` to break cycles and observe without owning
- Raw pointers only for non-owning references and performance-critical sections

### RAII Implementation

- Every resource acquisition paired with automatic cleanup
- Exception-safe resource management throughout
- Custom RAII wrappers for system resources
- Scope-based resource management

### Custom Allocation

- Memory pools for frequent allocations
- Custom allocators for specific use cases
- Stack allocators for temporary objects
- Profiling-guided optimization

## Error Handling Architecture

### Exception Hierarchy

```cpp
std::exception
├── CppVerseException (base for all custom exceptions)
│   ├── EntityException
│   │   ├── PlanetException
│   │   └── FleetException
│   ├── MissionException
│   │   ├── NavigationException
│   │   └── ResourceException
│   └── SystemException
│       ├── ConfigurationException
│       └── ConcurrencyException
```

### Exception Safety Levels

- **No-throw guarantee**: For destructors and swap operations
- **Strong guarantee**: For most operations (transaction-like behavior)
- **Basic guarantee**: Minimum acceptable level (no leaks, consistent state)
- **No guarantee**: Only for performance-critical code with explicit documentation

## Performance Considerations

### Compile-Time Optimization

- Template metaprogramming for zero-runtime-cost abstractions
- `constexpr` functions for compile-time computation
- Template specialization for optimized implementations
- SFINAE for conditional compilation

### Runtime Optimization

- Move semantics to avoid unnecessary copies
- Perfect forwarding in template functions
- Reserve capacity for containers when size is known
- Cache-friendly data structures and access patterns

### Profiling and Benchmarking

- Memory usage profiling capabilities
- Performance regression detection
- Optimization verification through measurement
